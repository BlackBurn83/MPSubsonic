This should become a Subsonic plugin for MediaPortal.

Be kind these are my first steps in MP Plugin development and it has been a long time since I wrote code.

** THIS IS STILL VERY VERY ALPHA AND IS DEFINITELY UNSTABLE **
But I still encourage the brave of you, to test it out and tell me what can be better and what is missing.

[INSTALLING]
- Copy the MPSubsonic.dll from the bin directory to your mediaportal plugin directory.
	default: c:\program files\team mediaportal\mediaportal\plugins\windows)
- Copy the MPSubsonic.xml from the skin to your skin directory.
	default: c:\programdata\team mediaportal\mediaportal\skin\defaultwide)

[KNOWN LIMITATIONS]
- Songs placed in the root of a base (MusicFolder) won't appear in the list.
- URL stream is requested with username & password within the request!!! (So inside use only, would be a good idea!)

[COMPILING]
The following references should be added, due the differences between a 64 bit or 32 bit Windows (the program files path), the references aren't always loaded.
- ..\mediaportal\core.dll
- ..\mediaportal\databases.dll
- ..\mediaportal\common.utils.dll
- ..\mediaportal\utils.dll
- ..\mediaportal\plugins\windows\dialogs.dll
